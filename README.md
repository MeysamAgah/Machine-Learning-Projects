# Projects
In this Repository you can find my Machine Learning and Data Science Projects<br>
## Traditional Machine Learning<br>
#### Linear Regression<br>
in these projects I implemented a Linear Regression model [from scratch](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20from%20scratch.ipynb) and using [normal equation](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20By%20Using%20Normal%20Equation.ipynb).<br>
#### [Online News Popularity](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Online%20News%20Popularity.ipynb)<br>
this was my first machine learning project.<br>
contains EDA, hypothesis tests, scaling methods, feature selection and Regression approaches.<br>
#### [Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Insurance%20Claim%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)<br>
this project involves dealing with imbalanced data<br>
contains EDA, resampling data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification approaches.<br>
#### [SuperMarket](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/SuperMarket%20dataset.ipynb)<br>
For SuperMarket Dataset I used unsupervised learning approaches.<br>
contains EDA, Dimension reduction, Clustering.
#### [Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Spaceship_Titanic.ipynb)<br>
This project consist of three steps:<br>
first Exploratory Data Analysis, second imputing missing values using machine learning models, and finally hyperparameter tuning on different ML models and choosing best one.<br>
<br>
will be updated...<br>
<br>
## Deep Learning<br>
my deep learning projects contains implementing MLP on [EMNIST dataset](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/EMNIST.ipynb) and [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Fashion%20MNIST.ipynb).<br>
<br>
will be updated...<br>
<br>
## Recommender Systems<br>
#### [Movies Dataset](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Recommender%20Systems.ipynb)
in this project I implemented a recommender system for movies dataset.<br>
i used content based filtering and collaborative filtering methods such as KNN and [SVD](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Recommender%20System%20SVDipynb.ipynb) matrix factorization.<br>
<br>
this will be updated...<br>
<br>
## Graph Neural Network<br>
#### [HIV](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/GNN%20Classification.ipynb)<br>
this project is about implementing GNN for classification on HIV datasets which was introduced by the Drug Therapeutics Program (DTP) AIDS Antiviral Screen, which tested the ability to inhibit HIV replication for over 40000 compounds utilizing NetworkX and DGL libraries.<br>
#### [ESOL](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/GNN%20Regression.ipynb)<br>
this project is about implementing GNN for regression on ESOL dataset which is a small dataset consisting of water solubility data for some compounds.<br>
<br>
this will be updated...<br>
<br>
## Big Data<br>
#### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)<br>
in this project I used Pyspark to implement Machine Learning models on credit card fraud detection dataset.<br>
<br>
this will be updated...<br>
