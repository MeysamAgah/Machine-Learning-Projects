# Machine-Learning-Projects
In this Repository you can find my Machine Learning and Data Science Projects<br>
## Traditional Machine Learning<br>
#### Linear Regression<br>
in these projects I implemented a Linear Regression model [from scratch](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20from%20scratch.ipynb) and using [normal equation](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20By%20Using%20Normal%20Equation.ipynb).<br>
#### Online News Popularity<br>
[this](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Online%20News%20Popularity.ipynb) was my first machine learning project.<br>
contains EDA, hypothesis tests, scaling methods, feature selection and Regression approaches.<br>
#### Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection<br>
this [project](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Insurance%20Claim%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb) involves dealing with imbalanced data<br>
contains EDA, resampling data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification approaches.
#### Spaceship Titanic<br>
This [project](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Spaceship_Titanic.ipynb) consist of three steps:<br>
first Exploratory Data Analysis, second imputing missing values using machine learning models, and finally hyperparameter tuning on different ML models and choosing best one.
