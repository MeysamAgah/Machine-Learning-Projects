# Machine-Learning-Projects
In this Repository you can find my Machine Learning and Data Science Projects<br>
## Traditional Machine Learning<br>
#### Linear Regression<br>
in these projects I implemented a Linear Regression model [from scratch](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20from%20scratch.ipynb) and using [normal equation](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20By%20Using%20Normal%20Equation.ipynb).
#### [Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Spaceship_Titanic.ipynb)<br>
This projects consist of three steps:<br>
first Exploratory Data Analysis, second imputing missing values using machine learning models, and finally hyperparameter tuning on different ML models and choosing best one.
